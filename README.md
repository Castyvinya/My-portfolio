# My-portfolio
This project is a responsive personal portfolio webpage designed to showcase my skills, educational background, and contact information. It is fully responsive, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I used HTML to create the structure and CSS for styling and responsiveness. This project highlights my ability to create clean and user-friendly web designs.
